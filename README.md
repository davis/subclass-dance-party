#subclass-dance-party

A fun little exploration in polymorphism and inheritance. Golddiggers will chase the ballers and steal their money! When patrons run out of money, they leave the club.

##Technologies used
This repo was built mostly in pseudoclassical JavaScript, jQuery for DOM manipulation, and tested with Chai/Mocha.

This is a copy of the work I did on a private repo, originally a project from
[Hack Reactor's](http://hackreactor.com) curriculum. This project was worked
on with a pair; it's representative of the kind of problems that I've tackled,
but not of my solo work.
